Yeah, people are being killed because they are Christian, but I don't think the religion requires people to die for it. Matthew 10:33 (re denying) applies to normal social situations like our conversation, not a murderous scene with ignorant attackers. Matthew 7:6 is a caution about 'tossing our pearls' lest we be \"torn to pieces.\" It is absolutely nobody's business what you believe, so you are not required to tell them and jeopardize yourself. Jesus asks Peter, 'will you really die for me' (Jn 13:38), but Jesus does not demand Peter's death. Later, Jesus gives Peter a chance to affirm loyalty (Jn 21:15). No retribution. Jesus was hardly standing up for himself at his trials, and he was not confronting his accusers (James 5:6). Sometimes the less said the better, although it didn't save him, Jesus did not oppose or antagonize them.",

There was no Prime Minister or federal government 150 years ago.  I believe that the office was created as part of a partnership with the duties of each set out in the Constitution.  Health care was a provincial responsibility until the Federal Government imposed itself upon the issue by the creation of the Canada Health Act while promising to fund 50% of the cost.  Haven't they broken the contract by reducing the federal portion to less than 20% and going down?\n\nMaybe it's time for the SCoC to step in again, as they did with PM Pierre Trudeau, when he was told that he couldn't act unilaterally without provincial agreement to bring home the Constitution.  In my opinion such an arrogant Canadian Federal Government needs to be put in its place Constitutionally.",

Fact remains that this train is needed to help meet the needs of moving a lot of people from west Oahu into town.  Other areas of the island have received their improvements, now it is time for West Oahu to receive theirs.  Just build it already and study exactly why costs went up so much.  It is not just because politicians were dipping their beaks into money or that Hawaii is a democratic state.",

I don't know what the correct fee would be...but they can be raised until developers slow down to a slower pace.  (Keep in mind that limits in inventory will raise rents and prices).  Also, current zoning allows a developer to build a complex with only 0.7 parking spaces per unit....which is absolutely ludicrous. Requiring more spaces per unit will limit the number of units which can be built on a single parcel of land.  And it will mitigate overflow parking in which residents of high density housing start parking in surrounding neighborhoods due to the lack of parking in their own complex.  Those are two...and probably others can think of additional means.\nSteve Dorman",

Understanding the myriad of medication choices and what each means to the patient outcomes is extremely complex.  Add to that the fact that very few patients take responsibility for their own health care and the information load is overwhelming for many.  Serious health issues require serious work to overcome.  Everyone has the ability to track their symptoms and outcomes, but how many keep detailed notes of their appointments and their treatments?",

Most of the arithmetic you need you get by the end of grade 6, unless you are going to be some type of engineer.  Math is to teach logical thought.  Math is there to teach students how to think.  Math is there to allow you to develop problem solving skills that transfer to life.  Math matters.\n\nMath curriculum developers need to understand Piaget\u2019s stages of development.  While I left teaching, my wife continued as an elementary teacher and some of the math she was expected to teach seem to well beyond what children of that age would be able to learn.  Provincial government Education departments seem to be giving in to illogical public pressure rather than curriculums that actually meet children\u2019s needs.",

I had bear prints in my strawberry beds yesterday.  I never carry a gun when I'm walking, because I don't want the weight, and because I personally think pepper spray is superior.  It's easy to carry, easy to deploy,  and accuracy isn't an issue.  I also like the fact that it isn't lethal, which was the point of my initial post.",

Specifically, O&G contributed about 50% of the 0.6% increase in GDP for that month whereas real estate contributed nothing and actually declined by 0.2%. http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/gdps04a-eng.htm",

The hospital system in the big city I lived in had \"satellite\" clinics all over in community neighborhoods, I worked as a student in several of them.

What everyone agrees on is don't cook bacon (and meats in general) at high temps. Best way to cook bacon: in the oven at 270. \n\nAnother thing to remember. Most studies on the effect of cured meats were done a long time ago, when the use of curing salts (nitrite , nitrate) was not tightly regulated. There are strict rules in place now, maximum established levels of nitrite in bacon (120ppm at beginning of curing). Furthermore, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is added to bacon, as it's known to reduce the formation of nitrosamines.",

Perhaps this is a typical mistake, of thinking Vincent started first with \"religious\" orders. In fact he did not and even the Daughters and Congregation of the Mission, founded in 1625 were not founded as religious orders but as active groups, not bound by cloister or other religious order rules. This year we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of that original foundation of the Vincentian charism. Over 9000 Vincentians of all kinds(including lay St. Vincent de Paul  founded by Blessed Frederic Ozanam) will gather in Rome October 14 -16 for a symposium and Pope Francis will address us.

I hear that Bristol Bay has more than they need.\n\nThe thing that decimated the population was hunting.  There are people on the west side of Cook Inlet that call themselves as whaling captains.  If they are no longer doing it, they would be former whaling captains.\n\nFinally, this episode demonstrates precisely the sort of respect for the resource that Alaska Natives have - which is not any better than anyone else living in Cook Inlet.  We are humans.  It is what we do if we don't work hard to keep the resource healthy, growing and vibrant.  Stopping whaling for a half century or so in Cook Inlet would be a good start.  Cheers -",

They had road victories in both series which eliminated the need to have a game 7 on home ice.  Plus they played better on the road in the first series.\n\nRegarding GF and GA, the team's GA was third lowest in the Atlantic division and fifth lowest in the Eastern conference.  Sens struggled for offence most nights during the regular season (you can thank a bad PP for that). I'd have to review all the final game scores but I think they had quite a few low scoring wins and several losses where they got blown out.  As a fan I would have been more worried about that statistic had they scored a lot of goals and the differential was still negative.\n\nIf it's any consolation, Pens or Caps will likely make it to the Finals, and you have not been robbed of your chance to see these two teams square off.",

So what?\n\nMy neighbour could do work all day long but without it being in the service of an economic return, he and his family will turn to their tiny plot of land for food and gather wood to burn for heat. We can all work without end. That's not the point. The point is can we work and generate the kind of income needed to enjoy the \"finer things\" (e.g., food and shelter) and the leisure time needed to enjoy anything beyond food and shelter?\n\nTake your argument of nobility in service to its extent and reduce the payment from the lawyerly rate of hundreds per hour to minimum wage. Now figure out how much of life is available to enjoy.\n\nI read your columns only to give my neck a vigorous workout shaking my head in disbelief that such insipidness gets published in the Globe & Mail.",

In the 1960's we had the technology to convert crude to gas efficiently. Hydrogen does most of the work, cleaner than coal, but coalwater can be more valuable than crude, if yer smart.\n\nIMHO:  TAPS wrecked Alaska, and it has forced the pattern of thinking into quicksand statewide.

And so what I did was I became very attentive to everything I said, did, or even thought.  When I felt it was wrong I would repent then and there.  It was a period of a long examination of conscience and a rethinking of my life.  No priest was involved.  It was between God and me.--a time of intense spiritual growth.\n\nI'd like to say more but it's a hard thing to hear.

However the cyclically adjusted amount was a $16.8B deficit.  So, by this measure, $38.8B of the deficit was due to the recession and $16.8B was not.\n\nIn total for the Conservative's 10 years when they delivered the budget they had $25.3B in surpluses and $145.6B in deficits for a total deficit of $120.3B.  Cyclically adjusted that drops to $7.8B in surpluses and $82.0B in deficits for a total cyclically adjusted deficit of $74.2B.\n\nObviously this is not the only way to measure such things.",

A legitimate demonstration honestly announces what it is and why, usually ahead of time. A \"stunt\" misrepresents some significant part of the event. In this case, Pence tried to claim that he had gone there to watch the game, and that his walkout was a spontaneous reaction to the kneeling. We have since learned that neither was the case. Thus, Pence's staged walkout was a \"stunt\" rather than a \"demonstration\".",
