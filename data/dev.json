He mentioned that he would check into the bills the residents pay to the city to see which individuals were struggling.

This will continue to add distrust in our government, add hardships to police and as a Mayoral candidate will admit in a debate how far he will violate the people for power?

The diversity of the food venues at the ASF is the best I've experienced anywhere in the Northwest. And they are all GOOD! In Tennessee all of the fairs pretty much depend on the carny food venues which are YUK. I would spend two to three days at the ASF and still not have enough of it. Half a day at the best Tennessee fair and I was more than ready to go home in big disappointment and a gut ache. One of the things at the Tennessee fairs that was very busy, I noticed, were the BATHROOMS. I wonder why? Not really. The exhibits at the ASF are amazing. Tennessee fairs had a few.

Some of these small businesses employ up to 200 people and are trying to compete in world markets.  The general consensus was that they cannot be competitive due to the soaring hydro costs and have no option except move their operations out of Ontario, primarily to the U.S.  This will have a devastating effect on Ontario's economy if enough of this businesses locate elsewhere.  I'm sure that there are many large businesses that are also weighing their options due to soaring hydro rates.  These rates are already scheduled to increase in the New Year which increases will only go higher when carbon tax is added. .  Ontario has become a disaster under the Liberal governments, not only with the highest hydro rates in North America but also a staggering debt load of over 300 billion dollars.",

So Paul Ryan's plan is to repeal the current taxes on those individuals making more than $250,000 and replace it with a tax on all employer based health insurance plans along with the privatization of Medicare and block granting of Medicaid. Since 90% of the American workers get their health insurance from their employers this will be a massive shift in wealth once again away from the middle class and into the already full pocket of the plutocrats who run this country via campaign contributions.

In another year or two, he will join the trash heap of 1st round QB busts.  \nBy divine providence, Elway got an opportunity to correct that draft error with an undrafted free agent in Sloter (without having to use a draft pick).  And for whatever reason, Elway and the Broncos decided they were not going to give Sloter that opportunity.  Jamal Carter got a fair shot to make the roster (as a UDFA) at the expense of Ward.  There was no talk about Carter playing against 3rd stringers or how it will be different in regular season games.  Sloter showed as much or more than Jamal Carter.

CSU loses more on football than men's track and field, golf and all of women's sports combined.  You really are in fantasy land if you think football floats other sports.  The exact opposite is true. The spending and losing on football at CSU just keeps going up and up and up since 2009 - even when faculty were on pay freeze. Revenue comes from academics.  Please look at the link I put up.  Football depends on huge subsidies from academics.  People don't donate much.  Ticket sales do not cover the cost of football or a stadium.  Your football is paid for by education and god forbid if someone points out the ugly truth since football is religion of the minority - not the majority",

Under the circumstances, why would Canadian officials ever again help Canadian citizens held abroad unless the legal regimes under which those being held are incontestably consistent with Charter standards?

Because for a variety of reasons they become pregnant and are not in a position where they can produce and raise another child. Women who have children and work ALSO see their role as mother/protector and nurturing of children and sometimes that's exactly WHY they choose to use an abortifacient, why they choose to use birth control or why they choose to have an abortion--to protect their interests and the interests of their family. So do not insinuate that women who would not choose abortion are somehow more \"womanly\" or something BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. All women have a protective maternal impulse--lesbian, straight, bi-sexual--all kinds of women have this. Still you are incorrect. Jennifer Markovsky who was killed by Robert Lewis Dear was assaulted for being a woman seeking healthcare. It was a political murder.",

The Constitution of the United States of America does not give the power of annexing territory to the Congress. It simply doesn't.

Have you spoken to Senator Warner or others to really understand the impact Hirst has on our state? I have been monitoring SB 5239 since February, where the House democrats repeatedly kick the bill back to the Senate without even trying to negotiate. And the bill simply rewrites legislation to put the State Dept of Ecology back in charge of water rights, they way it was before Hirst.  You know how this works - no old people will be deprived of meals on wheels, critical medical providers will continue to provide services without a contract and our children will get educated, etc. because this has happened before - when the budget gets approved, it will be retroactive.",

With tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese women reportedly being forced to be sex slaves, you would think that at least one of them would have come forward to make the allegation immediately after the war, yet none did.   It was not until the 1992, about 47 years after the war ended, that a researcher reported about the Japanese military operating brothels for its soldiers staffed with \u201ccomfort women\u201d or \u201csex slaves\u201d from the occupied territories.

There are at least 3 times more nitrates in a serving of spinach than nitrite in a serving of bacon. \n\nThe formation of nitrosamine is not well understood. What everyone agrees on is don't cook bacon (and meats in general) at high temps. Best way to cook bacon: in the oven at 270. \n\nAnother thing to remember. Most studies on the effect of cured meats were done a long time ago, when the use of curing salts (nitrite , nitrate) was not tightly regulated. There are strict rules in place now, maximum established levels of nitrite in bacon (120ppm at beginning of curing). Furthermore, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is added to bacon, as it's known to reduce the formation of nitrosamines.",

The false narrative, demonizing Hillary Clinton, has been a product of mainly Republicans and Fox News. Unfortunately some unthinking Bernie supporters have bought into it and say they now feel \"betrayed\" by Sanders and won't vote for Clinton.\n \nSanders didn't \"betray\" anyone. He chose not to take a petty, self-centered and ultimately destructive position by playing a \"spoiler\" in this election.\n\nSanders recognizes that, all else aside, Trump must _not_ become president. Sanders isn't a fool.",

However, BMO disputes the figure.\n\nLast year and this year I did two sizable transfers between BMOInvestorline and Nesbitt-Burns (both owned by BMO). My experience is the transfer time should be talked about in 'weeks' rather than days. The problem seems to be with BMOInvestorline. In both cases, after waiting a 'reasonable' amount of time (1 - 2 weeks) I called them to complain and the transfer happened fairly quickly after that. \n\nMy conclusion is that Investorline simply doesn't allocate very many people to deal with these transactions (note that stock trades, for instance, are completed in 3 days). Hence if you call up to complain, your file gets pulled from the pile and dealt with.\n\nI feel sorry to complain about this as, otherwise, they've been a good bank to deal with. \n\nOh well. If enough people complain, maybe they'll wake up and do something about it.",

Also in the past century bishops from the Old Catholic Church (recognized as valid by Rome) have participated in numerous episcopal consecrations in the C of E. Apostolicae Curae's main points rested on the wording in the BCP as revised in 1552 under Edward VI, relegated to the dustbin by Mary I between 1553 and 1558, and then reimposed in 1559 by her sister Elizabeth. The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662. From Rome's perspective, all legitimately ordained/consecrated priests and bishops had died out by that point, and the wording in the BCP meant no one ordained since that point was valid. With the wording restored about 100 years later and the participation of bishops from the Old Catholic Church since the 20th century, it is possible/likely that the impediment Leo recognized no longer exists.",

With huge negative implications for weighty issues such as climate change, reconciliation with First Nations citizens, equity and fairness.  This is not some academic game, it is our future that is on the line here.  Mr Trudeau and the Liberal Party must honour their promise that the federal election of 2015 would be Canada's last under FPTP.  All votes should matter and count equally, and should lead to a parliament that accurately reflects the diverse views of Canadians.  Votes and voters are not equal under FPTP, which routinely gives 100% to a party that gets well less than 50% of the vote.  FPTP is well past its best-before date, it's gotta go now.",

They have made him a pariah no matter what he does. \nI can't  believe that this hysteria over controlling America's borders is genuine concern. The person in your parliament who called Trump a fascist or some similar incident.... What does he think he's referring to? Why didn't someone say \"How so?\".  How would he answer? I don't think I have read a post or an article that condemns the U.S. for this that actually articulates what it is that's so upsetting. These frantic people are losing support in the U.S. now. They are in the minority now by a few polling points.  People realize it's not rational.",

Is the Globe and Mail the moral arbitrator of what is important and what is not?\n\nPerhaps the editorial board should consider that after the initial social media reaction, the story has been elongated and elevated to the mainstream media due to the BC Liberal attacks on the credibility of Ms. Higgens, attacks led by Laura Miller facing charges of breach of trust in Ontario.

No, being faithful to your wife is not asexuality, that is being true to yourself.  The problem is not my logic, but your sexual ignorance and the lack of self-awareness among asexual clergy.  Asexuality gave us sacred continence and the Platonic view of sexual love as being a secondary form of love.

Perhaps this is a typical mistake, of thinking Vincent started first with \"religious\" orders. In fact he did not and even the Daughters and Congregation of the Mission, founded in 1625 were not founded as religious orders but as active groups, not bound by cloister or other religious order rules. This year we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of that original foundation of the Vincentian charism. Over 9000 Vincentians of all kinds(including lay St. Vincent de Paul  founded by Blessed Frederic Ozanam) will gather in Rome October 14 -16 for a symposium and Pope Francis will address us.

I  have been grappling with that issue.  My thinking was that the companies actually displacing the need for labour should pay the social dividend since they are creating the social problem and should cover the societal costs they are causing. So, its really a subset of technology firms. I am looking at.\n\nBut maybe the net should be widened.  Do you think that would be preferable?",

I think rather Jesus was a reformer, not a warrior. I will guess the Gospel's money changers symbolize taxation of the poor if the Romans taxed the Temple (why wouldn't they?) and all donations to it had to be in the currency preferred by the Romans. Those making donations were required to bear the cost of money changing?? A simple solution to taxation at a single collection point -- the Temple -- would have been decentralization. Did Jesus think of this solution? Years later, the Jews did in fact disperse because the Temple was destroyed. But there was already a trend towards synagogues? Jesus paid a tax to the Temple (subject to Roman tax?) but under protest.",

This was just the start of their squeezing of wish balls.\nHe promised to shake things up, and that's what he's doing.

A company like that can carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet and still be a low-risk investment. One needs to understand each company's business model, what they do, their contracts and how solid they are, the term of their loans, the risk of changes in interest rates to them, changes in goods' and services' pricing etc. and how all of these changes can affect each company. The level of risk is very different for a company that sells a commodity vs. one that provides, for example, electricity under a 25-year fixed-price, adjusted-for-infation contract. \n\nIf you look at one number, the level of debt on a company's balance sheet, you have learned essentially nothing.  \n\nI realize you disagree.\n\nSFI",
